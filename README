This is project where I collected interconnect data from Booksim simulator and applied rnn and lstm to the data.

1. Feature-Engineering: All unnecessary features are deleted and saved to another files.

2. Data_Preprocess: Load the featured-engineered Data. Later data is preprocessed, reshaped and then saved in npy format.

3. RNN_Implement: Load the npy files and feed into RNN/LSTM etc.
